# Subham's ICDP notes
This repository is my work in progress notes from the ICDP sessions. ICDP stands for International Child Development Programme. In Nepal it is being conducted under ECEC (Early Child Education Centre). I took this session in hopes of becoming a better guardian for my future child. I figured others should also benefit from this. So I am putting my notes here. I hope you find it useful.

This session ran on a course of 8 weeks , each friday for 2 hours. At the time of writing this, I have completed 6 weeks. I will update this as I go along. 

I would also like to note that the classes encouraged communication between each other and sharing experiences. Pictures were used for examples and the class was very interactive. We were assignment to act out things we learnt in form of role play and take home questions whose answers/opinions were shared in next class. I will not be able to share those experiences here. I will only be sharing the notes I took. Please note that the classes were in Nepali and my translation might not be the best but I will try my best to convey the meaning.

## Day 1 
We looked at the curriculum of the course. We also looked at what is called the ICDP home. It had a base, ground floor, first floor and roof. 

- Base: The base was about Attitudes towards children It has 3 major points
    - Recognition of cultural and personal values
    - Thinking about children as independent individuals
    - Understanding their needs and feelings
- Ground floor: The ground floor was about emotional communication. It has 3 major points
    - Showing that your love the child
    - Observe and follow children's lead
    - Take turns having intimate conversations
    - Praise/Encourage/Understand
- First floor: The first floor was conveying meaning and expanding their understanding
    - Focused/Centered attention/talk
    - Explain now and surrounding 
    - Expand their understanding about now and surrounding
- Roof: The roof was about setting boundaries alongside your child
    - Stepwise planning
    - Helping when needed
    - Plan according to situation
    - Positive boundaries

We were asked what is a perfect child. We wrote down some points like curious, obedient, loving, smart and such. The trainers mentioned there is no perfect child and we should not be pushing our ideologies on our children. A curious child for example might look naughty to some people. We should not be forcing our children to be obedient. We should be encouraging them to be curious and explore. 

Some tips arrived from the communication between the participants and trainers. They are as follows:
- Talking to your children regularly is very important. It builds a bond between you and your child. It also helps you understand your child better. One tip is to question your child about their daily activities. For example, if your child is in school, ask them what they did in school.
- Never lie to your children. If you lie to your children, it will break the trust between you and your child. If you promise something to your child, make sure you keep it. 
- Answer your children's questions. If you ever stop answering your children's questions, they will stop asking you questions. 
- Eye contact is very important. It shows that you are listening to your child while they are talking. It also shows that you are interested in what they are saying.
- Let your child use more than 1 sense. Just looking at something or just listening to something is not enough. Let them touch and feel things. Let them smell things. Let them taste things. Let them hear things. Let them see things. It will help them learn better.
- When a child commits bad behavior, do not punish them. Instead, try to understand why they did it. Try to understand what they were feeling at the time. Try to understand what they were thinking at the time. Try to understand what they were trying to achieve. Then explain to them why it was wrong and what they should do instead.

## Day 2
Notes from that day:
- Children are not born with a blank slate. They are neither good nor bad. The surroundings and the people around them shape them.
- Encourage independence in your children. Let them do things on their own. Think of them as independent individuals and not your pet.
- Have patience. If a child is misbehaving, your goto goal should not be punishing them. Be patient. They might scream or cry. But be patient and try to make them understand why what they did was wrong.
- Try not to offload your responsibilities on your children. For example, if you are a parent, you should not be asking your child to take care of their younger siblings. It hampers their development.
- Try to read face. If your child is not feeling well, they might not be able to express it. Try to read their face and understand what they are feeling.
- Don't isolate your child from other adults. Example, you might ask your guests for juice but not ask your child. This makes them feel isolated. Give equal respect to your child as you would to other adults. Kids seek respect and love.
- Children don't do bad things knowingly. They do it because they don't know any better. You might be tempted to scold your child when they drop your favorite mug, this is wrong. 
- Downgrade yourself to your child's level. If you are talking to your child, sit down and talk to them. Don't stand and talk to them. This makes them feel inferior. You may feel like your are an adult and should not be playing with toys alongside children but do it. It will make them feel good.
- Make the kid try. If they are trying to do something, let them try. Don't do it for them. If they are trying to wear their shoes, let them try. If they are trying to eat, let them try. Only help them after they have tried.
- Practical experience and learning is efficient. Saying a cow has 4 legs and showing a picture of a cow is not enough. Take them to a farm and show them a cow. 
- Don't oppose, suggest. If your child is doing something wrong, don't oppose them. Suggest them what they should do instead. For example, if your child is playing with a ball inside the house, don't say "Don't play with the ball inside the house". Instead say "Let's go outside and play with the ball".
- Explain your plans and expectations. If you are taking your child to the mall, explain them what you plan to do and what your budget it beforehand. Doing this makes them less likely to throw tantrums.

## Day 3
Notes from that day:
- Children that don't get love tend to go to the dark side and commit crimes. There has been studies that found out that children that get scolded or beaten frequently tends to get isolated and turn to drugs and crime.
- A video of still face experiment was shown. It started with a mother in front of her baby smiling and reacting with expressions. Then on next scene, the mother was asked to not react to the baby. The baby was trying to get the mother's attention but the mother was not reacting. The baby started crying and screaming. The mother was then asked to react again. The baby was happy again. This shows that children yearn for attention and love.
- Act polite. If you are talking to your child, don't be rude. Even if a bad behavior is committed, don't be rude. Be polite and explain to them why it was wrong. Suggest them what they should do instead.
- Try to discourage lying. If you act polite and don't punish your child for telling the truth, they will be more likely to tell the truth. If you punish them while telling the truth, they will be more likely to lie.
- Try to make positive take even on negative things. Encourage positivity.
- Confirm that you're hearing your child. If your child is talking to you, make sure you are listening. Make eye contact. Nod your head. Say "Yes" or "Hmm" to show that you are listening. Being on your phone/TV while your child is talking to you is gonna discourage them from talking to you.
- Praise your child. Their efforts, their achievements, their good behavior. Praise them. It will encourage them to do more good things.
- Show them that you love them. Hug them. Kiss them. Tell them that you love them.
- Encourage and follow their lead instead of having them follow us. Its easier to show them how to tie their shoes. But let them try and help them if they need help. Follow their lead.
- Always start from positive things. If you are going to tell your child that they did something wrong, start with something positive. For example, if your child is not doing their homework, start with something positive like "You are a good student. You get good grades. But you are not doing your homework. You should do your homework."
- Don't compare your child with other children. Every child is different. They have different strengths and weaknesses. Comparing them with other children will make them feel inferior.
- Let them know that you're always with them. If they are doing something wrong, don't leave them alone. Be with them. Help them. Explain to them why it was wrong. Suggest them what they should do instead.
- Never isolate your child. You might be tempted to shoo your child away when you are talking to other adults because "You are a child and you should not be talking to adults". This is wrong. Let them be with you. Let them talk to you. Let them talk to other adults. Let them learn.

## Day 4
Notes from that day:
- Try to think being in the child's place when you feel like punishing your child. It does not feel good.
- "Lets do it together" is better than "Do it".
- Talk to them with them being the center of communication. Don't talk to them while doing something else. Focused attention/talk is good.
- If 2 or more options arrive from child for something, one way to deal with it is to tell them to do one today(now) and the other tomorrow(later).
- Include every child. Saying someone is smaller so they get priority is wrong. Include every child. Make it turn based if needed.
- Talking to your child about your day is also important. It helps them understand you better. It also helps them understand the world better.
- Everybody has their own love language. Your love language might be different from your child's love language. Try to understand your child's love language and use it to show them that you love them.

The trainers showed us a chart of 5 love languages. They are as follows:
- Words of affirmation/appreciation: Saying "I love you", "Thank you", and such. 
- Quality time: Spending time with your child. Talking to them. Playing with them.
- Receiving gifts: Giving gifts to your child. It does not have to be expensive. It can be a flower or a chocolate.
- Acts of service: Doing something for your child. For example, cooking for them, cleaning their room, helping them with their homework.
- Physical touch: Hugging them, kissing them, holding their hand.

But, make sure you do it in a way that your child likes. For example, if your child does not like hugs, don't hug them.

## Day 5
Notes from that day:
- Get focused on something together. Quality time is enjoying same thing together. For example, watching a movie together, playing a game together, going to a park together.
- Praise focused encouragement is a good motivator. But make sure you don't overdo it. If you overdo it, it will lose its meaning. Also factor in their age. For example, if your child is 16 years old, praising them for eating food is not a good idea.
- Explain often. Learning leads to motivation. 
- Don't command. Suggest. For example, if your child is not eating their food, don't say "Eat your food". Instead say "Let's eat our food".
- Involvement is important. If you are doing something, involve your child. For example, if you are cooking, involve your child. Let them help you. Let them learn.
- Explain the now and surrounding. For example, if you are going to the market, explain to them what you are going to do in the market. Explain to them what you are going to buy. Explain to them how much money you have and how much you are going to spend. Explain to them what you are going to do after you come back from the market.
- Don't be afraid to explain them about happenings. People tend to hide bad things from children. For example, if someone dies, they don't tell the child. This is wrong. Explain to them what happened. Explain to them why it happened. Explain to them what they should do instead. Mensuration is another example. This explanation should be age appropriate. It should also be gender neutral. Not 100% needs to be explained. But explain enough so that they understand what is happening.

## Day 6
Notes from that day:
- Punishment is bad. Be it physical or mental. Mocking your child is also bad.
- Centered talk. Get their attention, explain things and set this understanding as a base for future.
- Explaining the past, present and future of things will help them understand better.
- Make them make their rules. Implying our rules onto them is not good. Let them make their own rules. For example, if you are going to the market, ask them what they should do while you are gone. Ask them what they should not do while you are gone. Ask them what they should do when you come back. Ask them what they should not do when you come back. Get involved in this process. Help them make their rules. This sets good boundaries.
- Stepwise planning. Explain your plans in steps.
- Plan accordingly. If your plan might not work out. Convey that to your child. Explain to them why it might not work out. Explain to them what you will do instead.
